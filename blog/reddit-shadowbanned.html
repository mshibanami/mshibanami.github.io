Roughly 10 hours later, my account was shifted to a shadowbanned state. Due to this status, all my posts were automatically filtered out. I have waited for 3 months now, but Reddit didn't take any more actions. So I gave up this account.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In August 2025, I released a new version of my app called <a href="https://mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web/">Redirect Web</a>, and posted it in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/">r/macapps</a> as a self-promotion since it was allowed according to their rules. After that, my account was locked by Reddit, and all my posts were automatically hidden.</p>
<p>I wrote this article to document what happened, ensuring transparency regarding myself and my work. I hope this record helps others who encounter the same issue, even though I was unable to resolve it myself.</p>
<h2>Posts affected</h2>
<p>All of my comments, and my posts (which were just the following two):</p>
<ul>
<li>[Aug 2025] <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1mzpxlk/">[Big Update] Redirect Web 8 - now supports multiple browsers, not just Safari!</a></li>
<li>[Aug 2024] <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1ejqelt/">I made a Safari extension for macOS &#x26; iOS called Redirect Web, which allows you to redirect any web page to another</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>25 Aug at 1:04 AM (UTC)</strong>
<ul>
<li>I posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/">r/MacApps</a> for announcing <a href="https://mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web/release-notes/8.0.0">Redirect Web's update</a>, and I was replying to the Redditors until my account was locked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>25 Aug at 7:21 PM (UTC)</strong>
<ul>
<li>My account was locked by Reddit.</li>
<li>All of my posts were also removed with this message: <code>Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit’s filters.</code></li>
<li>I received the account lock email and reset my password as instructed, but my account remained restricted.</li>
<li>I sent an appeal to Reddit via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/appeals">https://www.reddit.com/appeals</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>~10 hours later</strong>
<ul>
<li>My account was <strong>placed under a shadowban</strong> by Reddit,
<ul>
<li>At this time, I mistakenly thought it had been fully reinstated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My posts still didn't appear publicly, so I sent a message to r/MacApps mods through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/macapps">Modmail</a> to restore them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>26 Aug at 8:58PM (UTC)</strong>
<ul>
<li>r/MacApps Mod Team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1mzpxlk/comment/nau0ur1/">posted</a> a comment: "Poster's account suspended by Reddit."</li>
<li>The error message <code>Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit’s filters.</code> was also replaced with <code>Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/macapps.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>27 Aug</strong>
<ul>
<li>I contacted mods via Modmail again, and they replied to me that they couldn't restore my posts because I'm shadowbanned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>30 Nov</strong>
<ul>
<li>I confirmed my account is still shadowbanned. I gave up my account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why did Reddit do it?</h2>
<p>I'm not too sure, but I assume these could have triggered Reddit filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last activity of my account was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Safari/comments/1jp5scj/comment/mkxlbuw/">5 months ago</a>, and I suddenly posted a self-promotion post and actively replied to other users.</li>
<li>I was using NordVPN. (Australian server, where I also live.)</li>
<li>I was accessing Reddit using Firefox Nightly without any extensions.</li>
<li>I was on Reddit overnight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Since my account was shadowbanned, other users can no longer read my posts. They are also gone from Google Search, which is a major loss in acquiring new users.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1ejqelt/">My older post</a> still has its title and my replies to other comments since its status is still <code>Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit’s filters.</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1mzpxlk/">My newer post</a>'s title is <em>[ Removed by moderator ]</em> and all my comments are hidden for other users, not even showing <em>Comment removed by moderator.</em> It's completely invisible for other users while I can still see it using my u/mshibanami account.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Could mods have restored the post?</h2>
<p>I don't think so, although I'm not 100% sure.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484365010196-Mod-Mode">Reddit's documentation</a>, I thought mods should have been able to approve my post manually. In fact, when they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1mzpxlk/comment/nau0ur1/">posted a comment</a>, the status of my post was also changed to "Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/MacApps." from "<br>
Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit’s filters." However, since my account was shadownbanned, they probably couldn't do it. At least that's what they explained to me via Modmail.</p>
<p>However, I have no experience as a mod and I couldn't find any official documentation about this specific situation. If you have more information, please let me know.</p>
